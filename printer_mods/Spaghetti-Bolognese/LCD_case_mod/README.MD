# LCD Case Mod

I have made some changes/improvements to the Mini12864 LCD case as follows:
1. I found the hot melt inserts to be difficult to align straight, on both the rear and front case due to the geometry and space constraints. I have therefore removed them and resized the holes accordingly. 
2. I have added a lip around the screen cutout to better hide the PCB board behind it. This is simply for aesthetic reasons.
3. I have added an E-stop button cover, taking inspiration from both the previous Voron LCD cover as well as the Prusa i3 design. This allows for both easier prodding of the E-stop button as well as improving the aesthetic of the case (in my opinion).
