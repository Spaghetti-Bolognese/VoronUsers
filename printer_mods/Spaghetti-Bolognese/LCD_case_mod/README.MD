# LCD Case Mod

I have made some changes/improvements to the Mini12864 LCD case as follows:
1. I found the hot melt inserts to be difficult to align straight, on both the rear and front case due to the geometry and space constraints. I have therefore removed them.
2. I have added a lip around the screen cutout to better hide the PCB board behind it. This is simply for aesthetic reasons.
3. I have added a E-stop button cover, taking inspiration from both the previous Voron LCD cover as well as the Prusa i3 design. This improves both the usability and aesthetic of the case.
